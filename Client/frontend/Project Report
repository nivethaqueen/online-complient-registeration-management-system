# Complaint Registration and Management System

## Project Overview

The *Complaint Registration and Management System* is a web application designed to streamline the process of registering and managing complaints. Built with *React* and *Create React App* for the frontend, this system enables users to file complaints online and allows administrators to monitor, manage, and resolve complaints effectively. The project is structured to include multiple components, including user registration, complaint tracking, an admin panel, and real-time notifications, making it a comprehensive solution for complaint management.

## Key Features

1. *User Registration & Login*  
   Users can create an account and securely log in to the system to register their complaints.

2. *Complaint Submission*  
   Registered users can submit detailed complaints, categorizing them as needed.

3. *Complaint Tracking*  
   Users can view the status of their complaints to monitor the progress of resolution.

4. *Admin Panel*  
   Admins have access to a panel where they can view, assign, and resolve complaints submitted by users.

5. *Real-time Notifications*  
   Notifications keep users and admins updated on any status changes related to complaints.

6. *Search & Filters*  
   The admin panel includes search and filter functionalities, allowing admins to manage complaints efficiently by category, status, or priority.

  Stores images used across the application, if any.

- *src/App.js*  
  The main React component responsible for rendering the application structure and routing.

- *src/App.css*  
  Contains the styling for the application.

- *package.json*  
  Manages the dependencies for the project.
